# CAT - Conference Assembly Tool

This repository acts like a metarepository for the JACoW Conference Assembly Tool (CAT) project.
CAT is the successor of the [JACoW Proceedings Scripts Package (JPSP)](https://github.com/JACoW-org/JPSP).

CAT is based on [Indico](https://getindico.io/) and currently consists of two objects:

- PURR - the [Proceedings Utility Running Remotely](https://github.com/JACoW-org/PURR) is an Indico plugin calling MEOW (and exposing its APIs to it as well). Documentation available at https://purr-docs.jacow.org.
- MEOW - the [Machine Editor for cOnferences Website](https://github.com/JACoW-org/MEOW) is a Web application that does the hard work on behalf of PURR. Documentation available at https://meow-docs.jacow.org.
